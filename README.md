# ML Interview Notes
This repository was created when I was preparing for a machine learning interview. I foresee myself utilizing this quite a bit in the future so thought it might be a good idea to create a running list of notes that I have taken. I realized that there were things that I was reviewing that I hadn't touched for a while, and it might be a good resource for others as well.
